            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Hi! I am Federico Migliavacca and I am about to start the third year of the Information Systems Engineering degree at the National Technological University (UTN). 
                During my time at the university, I have participated in a wide variety of software development projects, always taking a proactive and effective role in the face of difficulties that arise. 
                Which has led me to acquire soft skills such as working under pressure and a high capacity for conflict resolution.
                At the same time, I train myself through online courses and self-taught in technologies used in Full Stack Development with the aim of being prepared for a first work experience.
                I am excited by the idea of​​ being part of new projects that allow me to acquire new knowledge and experiences to become a better and more complete professional!</h2>
